Terriermon is a one-horned lop-eared rabbit-like Beast Digimon with a laid-back personality, often using the word "Momantai", a Cantonese phrase that means "take it easy/no problem". Terriermon has very large floppy rabbit ears which are often used for spinning attacks, such as in the move "Terrier Tornado", or to float and glide.
